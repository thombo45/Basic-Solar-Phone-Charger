# Basic-Solar-Phone-Charger
A DIY solar-powered USB Iphone charger built with 18650 batteries, a TP4056 charging module, a boost converter.

This project converts solar energy into usable 5V USB power using:

A solar panel for input power
Two 18650 Li-ion batteries for energy storage
A TP4056 module for safe charging
An MT3608 boost converter to step up voltage
An optional Arduino + OLED screen to monitor battery voltage and control load

In the future I plan to add an OLED display for battery voltage. I also plan to add a battery management system that will disconnect the USB port from the batteries if the battery voltage drops below 3.2 volts.
